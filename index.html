<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/3w0bvh/guide_how_to_getsign_up_forinstall_monster_hunter/" target="_blank">If you still haven't installed Monster Hunter Online yet, you can follow this guide.</a>
<br><br>
I personnaly recommend using the TGP program to install and launch MH Online for two reasons: The download is way faster, and it automatically logs you in.
<br><br>
You can get it <a href="http://tgp.qq.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, and there is a handy install guide already made <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/upFB4/new" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br><br>
The one part in that guide that you won't do is select MHO as it won't be installed yet.  If you have any issues with it saying that TGP can't launch the installer try out <a href="https://xupefei.github.io/Locale-Emulator/" target="_blank">This</a>.  
<br><br>
Once installed, TGP will have two options in the laucher,  click the second one.  
<br><br>
This will bring you to a page with a bunch of different Chinese games.  Click the third option from the left navigation and select MHO from the list.  From there click the big green download button and it will start installing.  
<br><br>
When it is done downloading, you will here the Monster Hunter Theme for a while while it installs your game.  At completion the music will stop and you will get a notification from TGP.  Unfortunately TGP did install one bloatware program for me when I installed MHO using it, so just go into Programs and Features, sort by date installed and select the one that doesn't say Tencent as the publisher.
